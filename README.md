# Amazon-clone-page
This project is a front-end clone of an online storefront inspired by Amazon. It focuses on UI/UX and front-end interaction patterns, not on back-end or payment processing. It includes a responsive header/nav, search &amp; filtering, product cards with hover effects, product details modal, and a simple client-side cart.
